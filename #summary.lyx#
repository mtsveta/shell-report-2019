Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goals of this project are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accelerate geochemical reaction calculations (chemical equilibrium and chemical
 kinetics) in reactive transport simulations using a novel on-demand machine
 learning algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implement missing geochemical capabilities and models in Reaktoro such as
 redox reactions, exchange, surface complexation, solid solutions, and other
 modeling capabilities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implement native support for PHREEQC databases in Reaktoro.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this past year (the first year in this three-year project), we have primarily
 focused on advancing the first goal above (the most challenging deliverable
 among the others).
 We summarize below the results so far achieved, followed by the major tasks
 we will concentrate next year.

The summary below aims to be self contained in an effort to enable those
 not so involved in this project to understand our latest achievements in
 a quicker way.
 Some parts, however, may require further reading in the subsequent sections
 for proper understanding.

Further improvements in the accelerated chemical equilibrium algorithm 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Accelerating chemical equilibrium calculations will always be mission critical
 in the simulation of reactive transport phenomena.
 This is because assuming aqueous and gaseous species (and also some fast
 reacting minerals) to react under an instantaneous chemical equilibrium
 model is a suitable simplification.
 The reason for this is that the rates of those reactions are in general
 much faster than the rates of subsurface transport processes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We extensively tested the on-demand machine learning algorithm (ODML) in
 a 1D reactive transport problem, where all chemical reaction processes
 were assumed to be controlled by chemical equilibrium.
 We considered a mesh with 100 cells, and executed 10,000 time steps.
 This required 1,000,000 equilibrium calculations, one per mesh cell and
 per time step.
 A Pitzer activity model was used to represent the non-ideal thermodynamic
 behavior of the aqueous solution.
 The choice for using Pitzer model is because of its superior accuracy compared
 to others (Davies, Debye-HÃ¼ckel), but also because it is one of most computatio
nally expensive aqueous activity models in the literature.
 The chemical system consisted of 36 species in 4 phases (an aqueous phase
 and three mineral phases, namely, calcite, dolomite and quartz).
 We obtained the following results:

A manuscript entitled 
\emph on

was submitted to the journal of Transport in Porous Media on November 22nd,
 2019.
 This manuscript presents our latest achievements on accelerated reactive
 transport simulations when using ODML to speed up exclusively chemical
 equilibrium calculations.

\begin_layout Standard
We have started the work on using ODML algorithm to speed up chemical kinetics
 of mineral dissolution\SpecialChar breakableslash
precipitation reactions in reactive transport simulations.
 Our preliminary numerical experiments, using a similar reactive transport
 problem, with calcite dissolving kinetically, produced the following results:

Rok, a reactive transport simulator (in its early stages) using Reaktoro
 and Firedrake
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Together with a collaborator, an expert in finite element methods and a
 long time user and contributor of Firedrake (
\family typewriter

\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "firedrakeproject.org"

\end_inset


\family default
), a Python library for solving partial differential equations, we developed
 a proof of concept of a reactive transport simulator: 
\series bold
Rok
\series default
.
 In this newly developed code, Reaktoro is used for the chemical reaction
 calculations and Firedrake for the solution of the coupled governing partial
 differential equations (species transport, Darcy equation, etc.).
 This simulator has allowed us to perform more interesting reactive transport
 simulations, considering higher-dimensions (2D) and strongly heterogeneous
 porous media.
 We plan to use Rok not only for simulations in general, but also as a testing
 platform to ensure that the ODML algorithms we are developing work optimally
 under more challenging geochemical and geologic conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe this project will also be helpful to Shell, as it will demonstrate
 how Reaktoro can be coupled with other codes to develop reactive transport
 simulators.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Planned research tasks for next year
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\emph on
Improving the search operations in the algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the on-demand learning algorithm, a new chemical equilibrium\SpecialChar breakableslash
kinetics
 calculation is performed by first searching for previously solved problems
 with similar input conditions.
 We currently use a nearest neighbor search approach, in which Euclidean
 distances are used to compare the new input vector with input vectors previousl
y computed.
 The nearest neighbor problem is then used to estimate the solution of the
 new problem, using exact sensitivity analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have observed, however, that sometimes the nearest neighbor is not necessaril
y the most adequate reference point from which a prediction is performed,
 which end up causing many unnecessary training operations.
 This is particularly more pronounced when the complexity of the chemical
 system increases, which leads to an increased dimensionality of the input
 space.
 Our research plan to resolve this issue is to explore alternative search
 procedures, such as, for example, rank each previously solved problem in
 terms of how often it is used as a reference problem to successfully predict
 others.
 We could start our search by testing these key problems first.
 We could even limit the maximum number of stored trained problems.
 Only those that have been been successfully used to estimate\SpecialChar breakableslash
predict others
 and has a 
\emph on
rate-of-use
\emph default
 higher than a tolerance would be kept in a dynamic database.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\emph on
Improving the acceptance criteria in the algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The on-demand learning algorithm is able to entirely bypass the iterative
 computing processes of solving chemical equilibrium and kinetics problems.
 The approximated solutions of these problems need, however, to be accepted
 or rejected based on some given 
\emph on
acceptance criteria
\emph default
.
 A rejection triggers a new training operation, which is basically the solution
 of the problem in a conventional way (e.g.
 using a Gibbs energy minimization algorithm), followed by a sensitivity
 analysis operation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, our acceptance criteria sometimes trigger more training operations
 than it should (i.e.
 some predictions could have been safely accepted, but are otherwise marked
 as not accurate enough).
 We plan to improve the acceptance criteria in the ODML algorithm by using,
 for example, 
\emph on
measures of disequilibrium of reactions
\emph default
.
 For example, if the saturation index of a mineral that should be in equilibrium
 is estimated to be sufficiently far from equilibrium, we then decide that
 the estimated equilibrium state is not accurate enough, and it must be
 exactly computed, using a Gibbs energy minimization (GEM) algorithm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This proposed test is potentially more adequate than the one we currently
 use: if predicted species activities and reference activities change by
 more than, say, 10%, we declare the ODML prediction is not accurate enough
 and a new training is performed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\emph on
Accelerate chemical equilibrium calculations when evaluating reaction rates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reaction rates of mineral dissolution\SpecialChar breakableslash
precipitation processes require, in
 general, the saturation index of the minerals.
 This in turn require chemical equilibrium calculation for the aqueous\SpecialChar breakableslash
gaseous
 species.
 We plan to accelerate the evaluation of reaction rates by speeding up these
 chemical equilibrium calculations, which may be needed many times during
 a single kinetic time step.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

\emph on
Test the on-demand learning algorithm on more complex scenarios
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, we have mainly used a 1D reactive transport example, representative
 of a dolomitization process, to test the accelerated chemical equilibrium\SpecialChar breakableslash
kineti
cs algorithms.
 We plan to use Rok for testing the accelerated chemical algorithms in higher
 dimensions, in more complex geologic conditions.
 We also plan to model a highly complex reactive transport process resulting
 from the the attack of seawater into cement and concrete systems (with
 collaborators from the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland).
 In this problem, we will consider ~100 aqueous species, ~60 pure minerals,
 and ~10 solid solutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, we will also consider more complex cases for chemical kinetics,
 including more minerals under kinetic control.

\begin_layout Standard
We also plan to:

 (the solver we currently use to solve ordinary differential equations)

 best solver for stiff ODE-systems describing kinetically controlled species;
